# Automated-Word-document-with-python
I did this as a hobby, the idea in the future is to customize the styles selections using a GUI

Automate your docx files by modifying the toDo.txt and customize the style by modifying the dictionary in functions.py

### Install python docx library
$pip3 install python-docx

### Run this program!
$ python3 main.py

### You can customize the styles by:
Modify the dictionary in fuctions.py

### Content is included in toDo.txt as a list of "Instructions"

/ti this is a title. /
/li this is a literal. /
/sb this is a subtitle. /
/ch this a image title. / 
/no this is a paragraph. /
