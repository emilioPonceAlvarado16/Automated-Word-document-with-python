# Automated-Word-document-with-python
I did this as a hobby, the idea in the future is to customize the styles selections using a GUI

Automate your docx files by modifying the toDo.txt and customize the style by modifying the dictionary in functions.py

### Install python docx library
$pip3 install python-docx

### Run this program!
$ python3 main.py

### You can customize the styles by:
Modify the dictionary in fuctions.py

### Content is included in toDo.txt as a list of "Instructions"

1. /ti this is a title. /
2. /li this is a literal. /
3. /sb this is a subtitle. /
4. /ch this a image title. / 
5. /no this is a paragraph. /
